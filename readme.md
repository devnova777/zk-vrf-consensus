# Proof of Random Delta

PoRD is a consensus protocol where the odds of each validator being selected to create the next block are always equal.

Consensus is established over a sequence of commitments (zero knowledge random numbers).

A 2/3rd majority of the known validators must commit to a block for it to be valid.
